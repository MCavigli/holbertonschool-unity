# 0x0C. Unity - AR Slingshot Game

## --- DISCLAIMER ---

This application is currently a work in progress.

## What is this?

This project is an augmented reality, "slingshot" game where the player pulls back on a piece of ammo and it goes flying into the targets and hopefully knocking them over.

At least that's what it will eventually be. Right now this is a work in progress. Much of the functionality is working, but currently it's not possible to shoot the ammo. I need more time to get it working correctly.

To play, install this on your phone and open it up. It will link to your phone's camera and scan for horizontal surfaces, which it will then visually map out. Tap on the surface overlay, press start, and go!
